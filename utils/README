Files in here are utilities for demonstration and testing purposes.  They often
do things you should not do in real programs, such as access libbgl internals.

legitimate demonstrations and examples.  Right now it's up to you to use your
best judgment to figure out which is which.  Eventually I'll get bored and make
the distinction more clear.
